When [Annibuliful](https://www.github.com/annibuliful) was working on his company project then he realize that he enjoys developing customization tools with Canvas API with some JS Canvas libraries. He needs to build a small business to reduce the gap between merchants and customers. 

### User side

---

Mr.A needs a shirt with his logo or text with a specific position, width, height and pixel perfect so he needs to schedule with his love shirt shop to discuss his shirt idea. So It might take longer than 2~3 days to finish the discussion of the design. It would be better to have a tool to help Mr.A to put his creativity with basic functionality such as Text, Image, All-over-print, etc. then he can order a custom shirt.

### Merchant side

After the merchant gets a notification of orders from Mr.A. Merchant can export shirt designs in SVG format or items information such as Images, Texts, etc to process further.
