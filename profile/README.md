We need to build a small business to reduce the gap between merchants and customers for custom shirts, bags, etc through their creativity.

## Old way

Mr.A needs a shirt with his logo or text with a specific position, width, height and pixel perfect so he needs to schedule with his love shirt shop to discuss his shirt idea. So It might take longer than 2~3 days to finish the discussion of the design.
After the merchant the requirement they continue to work on 

## New way

 It would be better to have a tool to help Mr.A to put his creativity with basic functionality such as Text, Image, All-over-print, etc. then he can order a custom shirt.
